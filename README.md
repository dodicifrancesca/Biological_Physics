# Matlab Simulation of the Two Open State Model

Ion channels are macromolecular pores in cell membranes. They represent the most fundamental excitable
elements in the cell membrane as through their opening and closing, they allow a regulated flux of ions, shaping
the signals and responses of the nervous system. The opening and closing of a single channel is a stochastic
event and as such it should be studied with the tools of probability theory. Single channels can also present
more than one open or closed states, with different transition probabilities between each other. Moreover, there
are channels showing the presence of substates of reduced conductance with respect to the fully open state. In
this article, the simulation of the current signal from a single channel with two open states will be carried out.
The same simulation will be repeated considering different conductances for the two open states. Finally, the
combined signal of up to 1000 channels will be simulated, in order to study the relationship between current
noise and number of channels.
